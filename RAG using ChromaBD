Unterscheidung between a truck driver and a driver. A truck driver is a professional driver who operates a large truck or tractor-trailer to transport goods or materials from one location to another. They are responsible for safely operating the vehicle, following traffic laws and regulations, and maintaining the vehicle in good working condition.\\nA driver, on the other hand, is a person who operates any type of vehicle, including cars, buses, and motorcycles. They are responsible for safely operating the vehicle and following traffic laws and regulations.\\nTo become a truck driver, you will typically need to obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL) and complete a truck driver training program. These programs teach you the skills and knowledge you need to safely operate a large truck or tractor-trailer.\\nSome of the skills and knowledge you will learn in a truck driver training program include:\\n1. Safety regulations and procedures: You will learn about federal and state regulations that govern the trucking industry, as well as procedures for loading and unloading cargo, and how to handle emergencies such as tire changes and fuel spills.\\n2. Vehicle inspection and maintenance: You will learn how to perform routine inspections and maintenance tasks on your truck, such as checking tire pressure, oil levels, and brake systems.\\n3. Navigation and route planning: You will learn how to read maps and use GPS systems to navigate to your destinations, as well as how to plan your route to avoid traffic and other hazards.\\n4. Cargo handling and securement: You will learn how to properly load and secure cargo on your truck, including how to use tie-downs and braces to prevent cargo from shifting during transit.\\n5. Defensive driving techniques: You will learn how to operate your truck defensively, including how to avoid accidents and respond to emergency situations.\\n6. Communication and customer service: You will learn how to communicate effectively with customers and other road users, as well as how to provide excellent customer service.\\n7. Hours of service and logbook management: You will learn how to manage your hours of service and maintain accurate logbooks to comply with federal regulations.\\n8. Trucking industry regulations and laws: You will learn about federal and state regulations that govern the trucking industry, including hours of service, weight and size limits, and other safety regulations.\\n9. Vehicle operation and control: You will learn how to operate your truck safely and effectively, including how to use the brakes, transmission, and steering system.\\n10. Emergency procedures: You will learn how to respond to emergencies such as tire blowouts, fuel spills, and medical emergencies while on the road.\\nBy completing a truck driver training program, you will gain the knowledge and skills you need to become a safe and successful truck driver.\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Ingestion of Data using Text

A story that is unique among all nations. We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it. That is what we are doing again. Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities. You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together. But over these past two \n\nSource:  /kaggle/input/president-bidens-state-of-the-union-2023/biden-sotu-2023-planned-official.txt\nText:  on the state of the union. And here is my report. Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong. As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothingbeyond our capacity if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. \n\nSource:  /kaggle/input/president-bidens-state-of-the-union-2023/biden-sotu-2023-planned-official.txt\nText:  Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come. We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand. We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking. A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos. We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea. That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.

So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again? For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs. Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs. Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies. But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth. We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak. Food inflation is coming down.
